# Schema Notes

Track changes to the shared inventory schema here. Each update should include:
- Summary of new or removed fields.
- Impact on Tauri and OpenTUI clients.
- Migration steps for stored snapshots.

Use dated Markdown files (for example `2025-10-05-schema-update.md`) when documenting changes.
